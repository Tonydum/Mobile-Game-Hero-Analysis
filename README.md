# Mobile Game Hero Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hero performance and player preferences in a popular mobile game. Using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization, the project aims to uncover insights into hero balance, player behavior, and game meta trends from 2016 to 2021.

## Contents
- `SQL Queries`: Contains all SQL query scripts used for data extraction and analysis.
- `Tableau Visualizations`: Directory of Tableau workbook files showcasing various data visualizations.
- `Data`: Folder containing the raw and processed data sets in CSV or Excel format.
- `Documentation`: Additional documentation including data dictionaries, methodology, and analysis reports.

## Key Insights
1. **Hero Balance**: Identification of overpowered and underpowered heroes based on win rates.
2. **Player Preferences**: Analysis of the most and least picked heroes, shedding light on player choices.
3. **Meta Game Trends (2016-2021)**: Trends showing shifts in hero pick and win rates over the years.
4. **Role Analysis**: Examination of the popularity and performance of different hero roles.
5. **Complexity vs. Performance**: Relationship between hero complexity and their performance metrics.
6. **Ban Rate Impact**: Study of how ban rates affect hero pick rates and win rates.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server**: For executing data queries.
- **Tableau Desktop**: For creating interactive data visualizations.
